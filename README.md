# Data-driven Control Examples

This repository includes some simulation examples for the "data-driven control of continuous-time MIMO LTI systems" applied to several systems. The files are uploaded as RAR archives of MATLAB codes and Simulink models. 

## Files:

1- Pole placement data-driven control (a 2nd-order academic example): DDC_ex1.rar

2- Optimal data-driven control (attitude control of a nadir-pointing satellite): DDC_ex2.rar

3- Input-constrained data-driven control (a 2nd-order academic example): DDC_ex3.rar
