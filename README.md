# Data-Driven Control Examples

This repository includes some simulation examples for the "data-driven control of continuous-time MIMO LTI systems" applied to several systems. The files are uploaded as RAR archives of MATLAB codes and Simulink models. 

## Files:

1- Pole placement and optimal data-driven control (2nd-order systems): DDC_ex1&3.rar

2- Optimal data-driven control (attitude control of a nadir-pointing satellite): DDC_ex2.rar
